# Crate patches for plugin compilation.
# Format: <patch-name> = <source-dir-relative-to-workspace>
#
# Used by:
#   - compiler.rs (include_str!, injects --config patch.crates-io.<name>.path=...)
#   - xtask dist  (copies source dirs to dist/src/<name>/)
#
# The patch-name is what appears in Cargo's [patch.crates-io] table.
# Plugins declare `foo = "0.1"` in their Cargo.toml; the host compiler
# redirects that to the local source at build time.
